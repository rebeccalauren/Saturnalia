									<p>
									When Cheryl was six her father went out <br>
									for a jar of mayonnaise <br>
									and never came home. <br>
									The reason could have been anything: <br>
									a pack of Lucky Strikes, a woman. <br>
									She told everyone in the neighborhood <br>
									her father was hunting <br>
									unicorns, his voice blood orange <br>
									and tentacled, echoing <br>
									through the bowels of the shot glasses <br>
									she lines up daily like prophets <br>
									on the bar. I want to tell her <br>
									that fathers have left their families <br>
									for far worse reasons. <br>
									What do you offer someone <br>
									who has lost half of her beginning? <br>
									Your father was a tyrant, <br>
									a minister of severed hands, a syphilis bringer <br>
									castrating the stones of animals. <br>
									Wherever he is, I promise you, <br>
									the natives are suffering. <br>
									Leaving crosses my mind, feigning <br>
									mental illness for a younger woman, <br>
									that tropical paradise of no responsibility <br>
									where mermaids reach up through silky waters <br>
									and pull off your boxers <br>
									and fire drugs into your veins. <br>
									Then a plate shatters in the kitchen <br>
									and my wife and son come banging <br>
									through the house like one of those furious parades <br>
									of dragons during Chinese New Year, <br>
									and I put my pants back on. <br>
									Once my son is asleep, my wife and I have sex <br>
									in the bedroom, not the wild <br>
									sex of Olympians thrashing around in the heavens, <br>
									but married sex, our shirts and socks <br>
									stuck to us like bandages, and, four feet from our window <br>
									the next-door neighbor strangling <br>
									the choke on his lawn mower, kicking the thing, <br>
									yelling, c’mon motherfucker, when the engine won’t start.<br>
