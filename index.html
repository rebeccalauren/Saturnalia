					<p>
					When Cheryl was six her father went out <br>
					for a jar of mayonnaise <br>
					and never came home. <br>
					The reason could have been anything: <br>
					a pack of Lucky Strikes, a woman. <br>
					She told everyone in the neighborhood <br>
					her father was hunting <br>
					unicorns, his voice blood orange <br>
					and tentacled, echoing <br>
					through the bowels of the shot glasses <br>
					she lines up daily like prophets <br>
					on the bar. I want to tell her <br>
					that fathers have left their families <br>
					for far worse reasons. <br>
					What do you offer someone <br>
					who has lost half of her beginning? <br>
					Your father was a tyrant, <br>
					a minister of severed hands, a syphilis bringer <br>
					castrating the stones of animals. <br>
					Wherever he is, I promise you, <br>
					the natives are suffering. <br>
					Leaving crosses my mind, feigning <br>
					mental illness for a younger woman, <br>
					that tropical paradise of no responsibility <br>
					where mermaids reach up through silky waters <br>
					and pull off your boxers <br>
					and fire drugs into your veins. <br>
					Then a plate shatters in the kitchen <br>
					and my wife and son come banging <br>
					through the house like one of those furious parades <br>
					of dragons during Chinese New Year, <br>
					and I put my pants back on. <br>
					Once my son is asleep, my wife and I have sex <br>
					in the bedroom, not the wild <br>
					sex of Olympians thrashing around in the heavens, <br>
					but married sex, our shirts and socks <br>
					stuck to us like bandages, and, four feet from our window <br>
					the next-door neighbor strangling <br>
					the choke on his lawn mower, kicking the thing, <br>
					yelling, c’mon motherfucker, when the engine won’t start.</p>
